/**
 * Given an array of 0s and 1s, find the position of 0 to be replaced with 1 to get longest continuous sequence of 1s.
 * Expected time complexity is O(n) and auxiliary space is O(1).
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1} Output: Index 9 Assuming array index starts from 0, replacing
 * 0 with 1 at index 9 causes the maximum continuous sequence of 1s.
