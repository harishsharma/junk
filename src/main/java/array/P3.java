/**
 * Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from start to
 * end, such that only one letter can be changed at a time and each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary. For
 * example, given:
 * 
 * start = "hit" end = "cog" dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"] One shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" ->
 * "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", the program should return its length 5.
 * 
 * Note: Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence. All words have the same length. All words contain only
 * lower case alphabetic characters.
