 * Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys: Key 1: Prints 'A' on screen Key 2: (Ctrl-A): Select
 * screen Key 3: (Ctrl-C): Copy selection to buffer Key 4: (Ctrl-V): Print buffer on screen appending it after what has
 * already been printed.
 * 
 * If you can only press the keyboard for N times (with the above four keys), write a program to produce maximum numbers
 * of A's. That is to say, the input parameter is N (No. of keys that you can press), the output is M (No. of As that
 * you can produce).
